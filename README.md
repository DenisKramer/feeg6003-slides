This repo holds public teaching material for the ACM 2.

## Instructions for gitpitch

The ```master``` branch contains a set of files for [gitpitch](http://www.gitpitch.com).

### Starting a new presentation

Gitpitch works with branches. A new branch should be started for each presentation:

  git checkout -b <branchname>

Please do **not** change files on the ```master``` branch. This will make it easier to merge global changes into individual presentations later.
